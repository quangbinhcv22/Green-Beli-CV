    content: '<align="left">To breed a new Green Hero, you will need two Green Heroes
      that have reached an 8 level AND not reached the maximum breed count.


      Each
      Green Hero can be bred a maximum of 6 times.

      Example: A Green Hero that
      has never been bred has a breed count of 0/6. After the first breed, its breed
      count is 1/6.


      A new Green Hero is created immediately once breeding
      is done, no waiting time.


      Stats of the new Green hero will be randomly
      generated (just like when buying seeds).


      Stats of Green Heroes bred
      tend to decrease by the following generations. For instance, the genesis generation
      is more likely to breed Green Heroes with higher stats than the F1, F2 generations.
      And so on.
